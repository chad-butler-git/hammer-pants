## Data Layer & Seeding

The application uses an in-memory data store that is seeded with representative sample data at startup.

### Data Store

The data store is implemented as a singleton object that provides CRUD operations for the following entities:
- Items (~250 items across all categories)
- Stores (3 stores with 10-20 aisles each)
- Shopping Lists

Each entity is validated using Joi schemas from the `grocery-shared` package.

### Seeding

The application automatically seeds the data store at startup with:
- ~250 grocery items across 12 categories
- 3 stores with 10-20 aisles each
- Each aisle contains 3-6 categories

You can manually seed the data store using:

```bash
npm run seed
```

### Development

During development, you can use the following commands:

```bash
# Run the development server with hot-reload (includes seeding)
npm run dev

# Run tests with coverage
npm test
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Vulnerabilities (intentional)

| CVE ID | Package | Version | Description | Location |
|--------|---------|---------|-------------|----------|
| CVE-2021-23337 | lodash | 4.17.19 | Prototype Pollution in lodash | src/routes/items.js |
| CVE-2022-23529 | jsonwebtoken (via jws) | 8.5.1 | Forgeable JWT tokens | src/utils/auth.js |

These vulnerabilities are intentionally included for security testing and educational purposes:
- The lodash vulnerability uses `_.template()` on user input without proper sanitization, which can lead to prototype pollution attacks.
- The jsonwebtoken vulnerability (via its transitive dependency jws) allows attackers to forge valid JWTs for accounts they don't own.

## üîç False-Positive Examples

| Package | Version | Pattern | Explanation | Why it's a false positive |
|---------|---------|---------|-------------|---------------------------|
| eslint | 6.8.0 | Dev-only vulnerable dep | Added to devDependencies | Not used in production; only for development |

This false-positive pattern demonstrates a common scenario where a vulnerable package is included only in development dependencies and doesn't affect the production application. Security scanners will still flag this vulnerability, but it poses no actual risk to users since it's not included in the production build.
