# GitHub Upload Instructions

Follow these steps to upload the renamed project to GitHub:

## 1. Initialize Git Repository

First, initialize a Git repository in the project root directory:

```bash
git init
```

## 2. Add Files to Git

Add all the files to the Git repository:

```bash
git add .
```

## 3. Make Initial Commit

Commit the files with an initial commit message:

```bash
git commit -m "Initial commit of Hammer Pants project"
```

## 4. Create GitHub Repository

1. Go to GitHub (https://github.com)
2. Log in to your account
3. Click the "+" icon in the top-right corner and select "New repository"
4. Enter "hammer-pants" as the repository name
5. Add a description (optional)
6. Choose whether the repository should be public or private
7. Do NOT initialize the repository with a README, .gitignore, or license (since we already have these files)
8. Click "Create repository"

## 5. Link Local Repository to GitHub

After creating the repository, GitHub will display commands to push an existing repository. Run the following commands:

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/hammer-pants.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your GitHub username.

## 6. Verify Upload

1. Refresh your GitHub repository page
2. Ensure all files have been uploaded correctly
3. Check that the directory structure is preserved

Your project is now successfully uploaded to GitHub!
