## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Vulnerabilities (intentional)

| CVE ID | Package | Version | Description | Location |
|--------|---------|---------|-------------|----------|
| CVE-2021-3762 | validator | 13.5.2 | ReDoS vulnerability in isEmail() | test/Item.test.js |

This vulnerability is intentionally included for security testing and educational purposes. The vulnerable version of validator (13.5.2) contains a Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) vulnerability in the isEmail() function, which can be exploited with specially crafted inputs to cause excessive CPU consumption.

## üîç False-Positive Examples

| Package | Version | Pattern | Explanation | Why it's a false positive |
|---------|---------|---------|-------------|---------------------------|
| marked | 0.3.9 | Unreachable vulnerable call | Added to dependencies with an unused file | Code exists but is never imported or executed |

This false-positive pattern demonstrates a scenario where a vulnerable package is installed but never actually used in the application. The file `src/unused/markdown.js` imports and calls the vulnerable `marked` package, but this file is never imported or executed anywhere else in the codebase. Security scanners will flag this vulnerability, but it poses no actual risk since the vulnerable code path is never executed.
